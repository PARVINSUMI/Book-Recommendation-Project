# Book-Recommendation-Project
Portfolio-Project-Ironhack


## Project Overview
This project implements a **Book Recommendation Engine** using Python. It demonstrates how to design, develop, and evaluate a recommendation system using both **content-based** and **cluster-based** methods. By the end, users can input a book and receive personalized recommendations based on similarity in features or metadata.

## Features

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handles missing and duplicate values in numeric and categorical features.
   - Scales numeric features for clustering algorithms.

2. **Cluster-Based Recommendations**  
   - Uses K-Means clustering on numeric features (`Page_Count`, `Avg_Rating`, `Num_Ratings`).
   - Returns top N books from the same cluster as the input book.

3. **Content-Based Recommendations**  
   - Combines textual metadata (`Author`, `Categories`, `Publisher`).
   - Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to find the most similar books.
   - Returns the top 5 books that are most similar in content.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Scatter plots for cluster visualization (`Avg_Rating` vs `Num_Ratings`).
   - Bar plots for top categorical values like `Author`, `Publisher`, `Categories`.
   - Optional: save plots as images for reporting.

## Project Goals

- Apply data science techniques to a real-world recommendation problem.
- Gain hands-on experience with clustering, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity.
- Build a functional prototype that generates personalized book recommendations.
